Collection of apps and resources for the Flipper Zero

This repository holds code (and other projects, potentially!) that
I've made for the Flipper Zero.

## bme280
This is my first Flipper app, a really basic app that reads
temperature, pressure, and humidity over I2C from a BME280
sensor. It's not particularly useful (and you're better off using
[unitemp](https://github.com/quen0n/unitemp-flipperzero)). However, I
have it here because it's so simple that it's a good starting place to
make other Flipper apps.
